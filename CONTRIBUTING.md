# Contributing to Webisters Site

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. This guide covers how to report issues,
propose changes, and get a pull request merged.

By participating you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- Report a bug (use the **Bug report** issue template)
- Request a feature (use the **Feature request** issue template)
- Improve documentation (use the **Documentation** issue template)
- Pick up an issue labelled `good first issue` or `help wanted`

Before starting work on an existing issue, comment on it and wait to be assigned so
two people do not do the same work.

## Reporting security issues

Do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and email `thewebisters@gmail.com` instead.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.2
- Composer 2.x
- Extensions: `intl`, `sodium`, `gd`, `json`, `fileinfo`, `curl`, `mysqli`,
  `simplexml`, `dom`, `libxml`
- MariaDB/MySQL if you are running database-backed tests

## Getting set up

This repository is a project skeleton installed with `composer create-project`, but
for development you work on the repository itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webisters/site.git
cd site
composer install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
php webisters start          # defaults to port 8000
php webisters start 8080     # custom port
```

This skeleton ships without a test suite. If your change adds behaviour that can be
tested, adding `phpunit.xml.dist` and a `tests/` directory alongside it is welcome.

## Coding standard

Style is centralised in the `webisters/coding-standard` package. This repository does
not ship a `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` yet, so match the conventions below by hand, or
add the config in a separate pull request.

- Every PHP file starts with `<?php declare(strict_types=1);` followed by the
  standard Webisters license header (php-cs-fixer manages the header, leave it alone).
- Library code uses the `Framework\<Component>` namespace; project code uses `App\`,
  tests use `Tests\`.
- Match the style of the surrounding code: naming, comment density, and structure.

## Making a change

1. Fork the repository and create a branch off `main`:
   `git checkout -b fix/short-description`
2. Make focused commits. One logical change per pull request.
3. Add or update tests for any behaviour change.
4. Run the tests and the coding standard fixer before pushing.
5. Update the README or docs if you changed public behaviour.

### Commit messages

Use short, imperative subject lines under 72 characters, optionally prefixed with the
area touched:

```
routing: fix trailing slash handling in RouteCollection

Longer explanation of why the change is needed, wrapped at 72 columns.

Closes #123
```

## Pull requests

- Fill out the pull request template.
- Link the issue the PR closes (`Closes #123`).
- Keep the PR scoped. Unrelated refactors, formatting sweeps, and dependency bumps
  belong in separate PRs.
- CI (tests + coding standard) must be green.
- A maintainer will review; address feedback by pushing new commits rather than force
  pushing over the review history where possible.

## Backwards compatibility

Webisters packages follow semantic versioning. Changes that break a public API
(signatures, removed methods, changed return types) must be called out explicitly in
the pull request description so they can be scheduled for a major release.

## Licence

Contributions are accepted under the MIT licence used by this repository.
